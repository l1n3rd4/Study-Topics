Quantum computing is a field of computing that utilizes principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits represented as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much more efficiently than classical computers.

In quantum computing, operations are performed through quantum gates, which manipulate the state of qubits based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases, demonstrate the potential of quantum computers to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.
